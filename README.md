## Overview

This sample project delves into building an Interactive Loan Calculator Dashboard using Syncfusion® WPF Charts and DataGrid. This dashboard calculates and visualizes loan breakdowns, EMI, and amortization schedules using real-time user inputs. 

### Key reasons to use Loan Calculator 
- Preview repayment schedules and overall costs before you take a loan, giving you confidence in your choices.
- Try out different loan amounts, interest rates, and tenures to instantly see how each factor affects your monthly payments and total outlay.
- Understand the long-term impact of your borrowing—see how changing the repayment period or amount can make a big difference in your financial journey.

When you launch your Loan Calculator sample, you’ll see all your charts and tables update in real time, giving you a clear, professional, and actionable view into your loan scenario.
